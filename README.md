The practice includes:

* Testing Next.js UI, API, routes, authentication and database interactions
* When to use unit testing, integration testing and end-to-end testing -- and why!
* Strategies for testing SSG, SSR, ISR and CSR (including cache updates and SWR revalidation intervals)
* How to use a test database for tests that involve data fetching and mutations
